# 3D-Fine scale Habitat Mapping of oyster clusters 
Creating fine-scale 3D habitat map from CT-scanned imagery using hidden point removal algorithm

The codes below present ways to : 
1) Extract visual surfaces from a 3D mesh
2) Summarize the data (surface area, roughness)
3) Plot results
4) Compare geometries among methods 

Go to 1_FMS.R for the R codes
Four different types of 3D habitat maps created from Cluster2 is uploaded here for practice. The rest of the files will be uploaded upon request due to file size limitations in Github.

A160_3 means, DPC 3.0 is applied and 160 images was used in the process of creating the 3D map.
You can open the files in CloudCompare software and subsample points and conduct geometric analyses.
